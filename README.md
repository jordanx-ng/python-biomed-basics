# Python Biomedical Basics

This repository contains simple Python scripts developed to build
computational thinking for biological and biomedical data analysis.

## Scripts

### mutation_counter.py
Counts the frequency of genetic mutations using Python dictionaries.
This mirrors mutation frequency analysis used in population genomics
and viral surveillance, which are relevant in vaccinology and immunology.

### sequence_stats.py
Computes basic DNA sequence statistics such as length and nucleotide
composition. These checks are foundational in sequence quality control
prior to downstream immunological or genomic analyses.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals (loops, conditionals, dictionaries)
- String manipulation for biological data
- Quantitative reasoning applied to life science problems
- Clear documentation and reproducible analysis

## Relevance to Applied Biomedicine
These scripts reflect early-stage computational workflows used in
biomedical research, including vaccine development, immune response
analysis, and genomic data preprocessing.

This repository forms part of my preparation for postgraduate training
in applied biomedicine with a focus on vaccinology and immunology.
