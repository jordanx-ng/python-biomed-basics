# Python Biomedical Basics

This repository contains simple Python scripts demonstrating
basic computational thinking applied to biological data.

## Scripts

### mutation_counter.py
Counts the frequency of genetic mutations using Python dictionaries.
This mimics mutation frequency analysis commonly used in genomics.

### sequence_stats.py
Calculates basic DNA sequence statistics such as length and nucleotide
composition, which are foundational steps in sequence quality control.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python basics
- Dictionaries and loops
- String manipulation
- Biological data reasoning

## Relevance to Biomedicine
These scripts reflect early-stage computational approaches used in
genomics, immunology, and vaccine research.
