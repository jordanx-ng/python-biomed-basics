# Python Biomedical Basics

This repository contains beginner-friendly Python scripts that apply
core programming concepts to biological and biomedical data.

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in my
computational thinking for applications in **drug discovery and development**,
including target analysis, genetic variation, and basic biological data processing.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice Python fundamentals in a biomedical context
- Learn how biological data can be processed programmatically
- Build computational skills relevant to drug discovery and translational research
- Develop clean, readable scripts suitable for version control on GitHub

---

## 🧪 Scripts Included

### 1️⃣ `mutation_counter.py`
Counts the frequency of mutations in a DNA sequence.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Strings and loops
- Dictionaries for frequency counting
- Basic biological interpretation of sequence variation

**Relevance to drug discovery:**
Mutation frequency analysis is relevant to:
- target validation
- understanding genetic variants that may affect drug response
- early-stage genomic data exploration

---

### 2️⃣ `sequence_stats.py`
Computes basic statistics from a DNA sequence, including:
- sequence length
- nucleotide counts (A, T, C, G)
- GC content

**Skills demonstrated:**
- String processing
- Dictionary usage
- Simple biological data summarization

**Relevance to drug discovery:**
Basic sequence statistics are commonly used in:
- target and gene characterization
- early bioinformatics analysis
- quality checks in molecular biology workflows

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries only (no external dependencies)

---

## 📈 Learning Context

This repository was built alongside:
- CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python)
- Kaggle Learn (Python fundamentals)

It reflects my early-stage progression from pure life science
towards **data-aware and computationally informed biomedical research**.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Planned future expansions:
- pandas-based biomedical data cleaning
- analysis of experimental or clinical datasets
- SQL-based querying of structured biomedical data
